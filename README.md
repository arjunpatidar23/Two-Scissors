# Two-Scissors
“TWO SCISSORS” is a web-based salon management website with appointment scheduling
functionality. It connects clients, salons, and stylists in an online community allowing users to
browse salons and stylists, and book or training appointments. Salons can specify the stylists
that work at their salons, as well as the services and training they offer. “TWO SCISSORS” fills
this void in a way that is on-demand, easy to use, and effective for users and salon managers.
My project will use HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT in Front interface and MYSQL, PHP to back
the interface with strong database functionality. The final deliverable will be a functioning
website that can handle all specified use cases. Some of the major use cases include user
account registration, login/logout, appointment scheduling, schedule viewing, adding stylists
and services to a salon account, adding schedules to stylist account, accumulating points in a
client account
